            Hello, and welcome to my portfolio.

<br>
I’m Tanmay Goyal, a Computer Science Engineering student at Delhi Technological University (DTU).

<br>
<br>

My guiding philosophy is that innovation doesn't happen in a silo. The best solutions are born at the intersection of disciplines—where technology meets creativity, and analytics meets artistry. I've built my journey around this belief, diving deep into the worlds of artificial intelligence, quantitative finance, and music production.

        <h2 style="text-align: center; padding-top: 20px;">🤖 The Technologist & Innovator</h2>
        <h4 style="text-align: center; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">
        My core focus is on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Autonomous Systems. I don't just want to study theory; I want to build.

At DTU, I'm actively involved in several high-impact technical teams:<h2></h2>
        
    <ul style="padding-bottom: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
        <li>
            As a Software Technician at UAS-DTU, I develop AI, computer vision, and autonomous navigation systems for drones.
        </li>
        <li>
            At AIMS-DTU, I explore the cutting edge of AI, from deep learning models to generative AI.

        </li>
        <li>
            My work with Team Defianz Racing as an Autonomous Department Recruit gave me hands-on experience with the Robot Operating System (ROS) and the challenge of building self-driving vehicles.
        </li>
    </ul>    
    <h4 style="text-align: center; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;">
        This passion for building impactful solutions started long before university. For over five years, I was an active member of the NITI Aayog and Atal Innovation Mission (ATL) ecosystem. I’ve led multiple startup projects, pitching and presenting concepts at national-level events. My flagship project, "DOCVEDIC," is an AI-based smart doctor, a concept recognized at the ATL Marathon, Young Scientist India, and as a Grand Finalist at the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2022.

        <h2 style="text-align: center; padding-top: 20px;">📈 The Quantitative Analyst</h2>
        <h4 style="text-align: center; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">
        My analytical drive extends beyond code and into the complex world of finance. I am fascinated by the patterns, strategies, and quantitative models that drive markets.

This passion culminated in my role as a Research Analyst and Innovation Head for our team in the Wharton Global Youth Program Investment Competition. This wasn't just a competition; it was an 11-month deep dive into fundamental analysis, technical strategy, and algorithm design.

I developed new tools for client analysis and portfolio allocation, including:</h4>
        
    <ul style="padding-bottom: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; ">
        <li>
            Bearish Bullish Calculator (BBC): An AI-based predictor for short-term stock movements.
        </li>
        <li>
            Orionis Pricing Model: A flagship asset allocation model to optimize portfolios based on client risk and goals.

        </li>
        
    </ul>    
    <h4 style="text-align: center; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;">
        This fusion of AI, mathematics, and investment strategy was incredibly rewarding. I am immensely proud to have led my team to become Semifinalists, placing us among the Top 50 teams globally in this prestigious competition.

        <h2 style="text-align: center; padding-top: 20px;">🎹 The Creative</h2>
        <h4 style="text-align: center; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;">
        Beyond the keyboard of my laptop, I am equally at home on the keyboard of a piano. Music is not just a hobby; it’s a core part of my identity and a discipline I’ve pursued for years.
<br>

I am a certified Pianist, having formally passed my examinations from the prestigious Trinity College London. My musical foundation is also rooted in Indian traditions, as a Certified Classical Music Player from Prayag Sangeet Samiti.
<br>

This passion for performance naturally evolved into creation. I am a Music Producer, with my original work officially released on major platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube. This artistic pursuit has taught me the power of discipline, the structure of composition, and the nuance of creative expression—principles I apply to my technical projects every day.
